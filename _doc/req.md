# Leakmited technical test for developers

## Objective

The goal of this test is to assess your technical ability to integrate with our team at Leakmited. Our work primarily involves displaying and interacting with data on a map. In this task, you will create an application using SvelteKit to display a dashboard with statistics and data visualization on a map.

Youâ€™ll have up to **2 weeks** to complete the test

## Contact
